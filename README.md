Used Car Price Prediction Model:
This repository contains code and data to build a machine learning model that predicts the prices of used cars based on certain features.

Data:
The data used in this project contains information about used cars including the make, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type,
transmission type, owner, number of seats, torque, mileage, engine, and maximum power.

Model:
The model used to predict the prices of used cars is a Random Forest Regressor. The features used in the model include the kilometer driven, fuel type, seller type,
transmission type, owner, number of seats, torque, mileage, engine, and maximum power. OneHotEncoder was used for encoding categorical variables.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

Usage:
To use this model, you can download the repository and open the Jupyter Notebook file. Then, you can run the code to train the model on the provided dataset.
Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the prices of new cars based on their features.

Results:
The model achieved an accuracy of 93% on the test data, which indicates that it is a highly accurate predictor of used car prices.
